# Runs a load test (docs/architecture.md, section 17) with k6, Compose's `k6` service (profile
# `load-tests`, nothing to install), against the services running on this machine, then checks the
# verdict: p95, errors, the events reconciled, dead letters, queues, failed traces, error logs and
# alerts. Exits with k6's code: 0 when every threshold passed, 99 when one failed. k6's metrics go to
# Prometheus through Alloy, tagged `testid=<test>-<UTC time>`: Grafana's k6 Prometheus dashboard.
#
# Usage: load-tests/k6.sh <test> [k6 run options, e.g. -e PEAK_RATE=150 -e P95_MS=80]
#   smoke             2 VUs for 30 s: run it first
#   stress            the usual traffic (90% reads), rising to PEAK_RATE and held; p95 under 100 ms
#   spike             the usual traffic, then SPIKE_RATE within 10 s; p95 under 200 ms
#   streak-stampede   a spike on the hot members' streaks, while they record workouts; p95 under 200 ms
#   backlog           with Training Progress stopped: recordings whose events wait in its queue
#   reconcile         after the backlog was moved and consumed: -e RUN_ID=... -e SINCE=... -e DLQ_BEFORE=...
#
# Needs: the three services (pnpm start:dev:<service>), the members (load-tests/seed.sh), and the
# observability profile. The admin tokens come from the services' .env, Grafana's password from .env.
# Each run is an annotation on the Fitness platform dashboard (tag `load-test`), and its reports
# (web dashboard, metrics, summary, console output) go to var/load-tests/<test id>/.
