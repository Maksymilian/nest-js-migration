# Seeds the load test members into the local databases (docs/architecture.md, section 17.1): each
# with a paired piece of equipment in Workout Tracking and a history of workouts, recorded in
# Workout Tracking and logged in Training Progress with the same ids, as if their events had
# already been delivered. Local only, and not a Liquibase changeset: volume for load tests and
# query plans, not test records.
#
#   load-NNNN@example.com    a workout every day for the last --days days, up to yesterday (UTC);
#                            equipment n % 3: a bike, a treadmill or a rower
#   the first --hot members  two workouts a day for --hot-days days: a long streak to compute
#
# The ids are md5 of a name, written as a UUID (load-tests/lib/members.ts computes the same), and
# the inserts skip rows that exist: running it again changes nothing. --remove deletes the members'
# rows, the ones the load tests recorded included, and their cached read models.
#
# Usage: load-tests/seed.sh [--members 1000] [--days 365] [--hot 20] [--hot-days 1500] [--remove]
#   About 420,000 workouts per database with the defaults (15 seconds); the load tests need the
#   same --members and --hot (LOAD_MEMBERS, LOAD_HOT_MEMBERS).
